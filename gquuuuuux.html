          <h3>High Grade 1/144 Gundam GQuuuuuuX</h3>
          <p>The gMS-Ω GQuuuuuuX has one of the most unique names and designs out of anything in the gundam franchize. taking heavy inspiration from Evangelion's EVA units, The GQuuuuuuX features a thin, feminine design with wide legs and a small body and arms. The colour scheme is reminicient of the origional RX-78-02, with slightly deeper tones. The gquuuuuux includes a heat hawk, beam rifle, dual beam sabers, shield, core fighter cockpit, and alternate head. The kit includes foil stickers for sensors and eyes, orange colour-correcting stickers and decal stickers for the red stripes.</p>
          <p>Though some fans dislike the departure from traditional gundam design that the GQuuuuuuX takes, I like it a lot. the skelotonized feet to make way for large boosters and highly articulate booster backpack clearly display that the the GQuuuuuuX was designed for space combat. the exposed fuel tanks in the thigh and shin reinforce the idea of a space vehicle over a person-shaped robot. Most gundam beam rifles are made up of only gray parts, but the one included in this kit has both orange and white details that make it look a lot more interesting. unfortunately only the beam sabers can be stored on the back of the suit, so the rifle, shield, and heat hawk cannot be equipped on the suit when not held in the hands. The kit has exellent articulation that can pull off any of the over the top poses from the anime. The small shoulder armors are attached to the arm instead of the body, allowing for less restricted articulation. On the elbow joints, the small blue rings can have a tendecy to fall off when posing so be sure to keep track of them or glue them in place. The included "deactivated" head lets you display the GQuuuuuuX without the psycommu unit activated. There are a lot of red decal stickers included that are a bit difficult to apply, but with a steady hand they look good. most of the orange colour-correcting stickers are in recesses, so you don't notice most of them as stickers. the beam sabers are unlike any beam weapon we've seen before, with a kind of chakram design instead of looking like a lightsaber. You can detach the backpack and attach the cockpit extra part to recreate the core fighter that can detach from the GQuuuuuuX.</p>
          <p>The HG GQuuuuuuX truly surpasses its title as a high grade kit. The way that the kit assembles is unlike any other HG kit released, and if you want something different and new with the same lavel of quality, the GQuuuuuuX is for you. Only because of the stickers, I give the GQuuuuuuX 4.5/5.</p>
