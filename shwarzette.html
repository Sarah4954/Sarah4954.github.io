          <h3>High Grade 1/144 Gundam Shwarzette</h3>
          <p>A unique Witch From Mercury Gundam with an angel/devil motif, Gundam Schwarzette is another excellent addition to the HG WFM lineup. The Schwarzette was built by the same in-lore company as the Dilanza, and you can see it in the design, especially around the chest and shoulder armor. Gundam Schwarzette comes with the Guardian GUND-bits, and beam blade. Foil stickers are included for sensor parts, and high quality reflective stickers are included for the shell unit and GUND-bits.</p>
          <p>For a Jeturk mobile suit, the Schwarzette has great articulation and a very sleek design. With a hoof shaped foot design and devil horns balanced out by a halo on the head, the Schwarzette looks both like a devil and an angel. The Guardian GUND-bit system is very unique as by default they form together onto the beam blade to create a beam gatling, split apart into the familiar swarm configuration, or attach to the back of the mobile suit in "Marionette" form. In Marionette form, the GUND-bit array is very articulate, adding even more to action poses. The beam blade is a unique sword melee weapon that has a much more substantial design than the standard beam sabers. Like most modern gunpla, the Schwarzette will be able to pull off basically any pose you want it to. The curvy armor plating doesn't have many opportunities for panel lining, but some decals do go a long way regardless. Gundam Schwarzette's unique design and build would make it a great addition to any Gunpla collection.</p>
          <p>Other than some hollow bit on the inside of the GUND-bits, there really aren't any flaws with this model kit. I would love to see a master grade version with more details and an inner frame. I give Gundam Schwarzette a 4.75/5.</p>
