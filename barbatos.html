          <h3>High Grade 1/144 Gundam Barbatos Lupus</h3>
          <p>One of the best HG kits from the Iron-Blooded Orphans line, Gundam Barbatos Lupus is an exellent and affordable model kit for beginners of the hobby. It isn't difficult to find one of these for an exremely low price of 17-20$ CAD for a protagonist mobile suit, making it a great pick for beginners or those wanting to experiment with new modelling tecniques sich as painting, water slide decals, panel line scribing, weathering, and battle damaging. the kit includes Barabtos Lupus' main weapon, the Sword Mace. Peices of the backpack can be swapped to recreate the sub-arms that assist in equipping stored weapons. Option part kits are seperately available that include the arm cannons and dual maces featured in the anime. Colour-correcting stickers are included.</p>
          <p>Gundam Barbatos is one of the most unique mobile suit designs in all of its forms, and the HG Barbatos Lupus pulls off the design well, with a few issues. The kit uses polycaps for most of its joints, so over time it can struggle to hold poses. I haven't experienced it, but a connection in the chest/waist joint can separate after being built, so it is recommended to glue those parts of the kits that use the IBO Gundam frame. The hip thrusters have large stickers for the blue aspects, which don't look that good. Barbatos' backpack also has colour-correcting gray stickers that don't look that bad, but are still a little disappointing. However, the green foil stickers on the knees and eye cameras look great. Because of the lightly armored design with lots of inner frame exposed, Gundam Barbatos lupus has great articulation being able to pull off nearly all of the over-the-top and animalistic poses from the anime. I use my Barbatos as a test bed whenever I try out a new tool or technique, so mine has been panel lined, had the yellow deatails painted with a gold finish, and top-coated.</p>
          <p>Due to the price, the HG IBO Gundam Barbatos Lupus is an amazing kit despite its flaws. Easy and fast to build, great design and posability, and almost unbeatable prive make this kit a 3.5/5.</p>
