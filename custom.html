          <h3>30 Minutes Sisters SIS H-00 Sestieh (Color C) custom</h3>
          <p>The 30 Minutes label kits from Bandai were designed for custom builds by having universal joints and hardpoints, so I figured one would be a great start for my first custom build.</p>
          <p>I started off by choosing Siesteh as my base kit, because her color scheme inspired me to use some option parts I had seen previously. I went for a sort of cyber-butterfly design with the large translucent wings, jet boosters, and thorax mounted to the back. I used some extra joint parts to mount her pistol and an extra sword to her sides, giving her four weapons total. I used a gold Posca marker to do all of the gold details on the katana, verniers, and inside of the gray claws on the leg boosters. I used some extra decals from my RG Nu-Gundam to have some extra details. Most panel gaps are lined, but I didn't do all of them. I originally planned to replace the arms with ones from a 30MM kit, but the regular arm ended up looking better. The only parts I ended up using from that kit were some armor plates for the shins and the katana. After buying everything, the cost was about the same to a little bit less than a Girl model kit with a similar amount of accessories.</p>
          <p>I'd do a few things differently if I were to do this again, mainly not ordering from AliExpress. Since the base Sestieh kit is a bit hard to find, I placed an order for it through an AliExpress vendor. The kit arrived, but it had taken over a month and the box was a little beaten up. Doing this again now I'd probably try to find all of the parts that I intend to use and order them all at once to save on shipping and not have to wait a week and a half with a pile of option parts and nothing to do with them. I would also put more care into how everything is going to go together before buying everything, and have a clear idea of what the end product is going to be. Even though I could have executed it a bit better, I still had a ton of fun putting together my own unique model kit.</p>

          <h3>Model kits and Option Parts used</h3>
          <p>First, I used the Spinatio (sengoku type) for its armor plates and sword. i origionally meant to use it more but decided not to and to keep it as extra parts. I used the Large Booster Unit option parts set for the leg boosters, thorax, and jet boosters mounted to the wings. Finally I used the cyber effect / multi-joint customize material set for the wings, and the joints that hold all of the accessories to Sestieh.</p>
