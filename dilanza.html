          <h3>High Grade 1/144 Dilanza (Standard Type/Lauda's Dilanza)</h3>
          <p>While the standard Dilanza isn't as flashy or popular as the hot pink Guel's Dilanza, it is just as good as a kit with a softer colour scheme and a more militaristic look. The Dilanza is the Witch From Mercury universe's most popular mass-produced mobile suit with a bulky, heavily armored design and a lot of boosters reminiscent of the old Dom mobile suits. The kit includes parts to be both the standard dilanza and Lauda's dilanza, beam torch, beam rifle, and heat battleaxe. A foil sticker is included for the vizor.</p>
          <p>The Dilanza sports a bulky, large design that can limit articulation, but encapsulates the idea of a walking tank perfectly. The subdued seafoam colour looks great on its own, but would look even better with a flat top coat to even out the shininess of the smooth plastic. The bulky skirting armor restricts leg movement quite a bit wich is a bit of a downside of the chunky design. Despite the bulky shoulder shields the arms have great articulation with double elbow joints. Even though the poor articulation limits over the top poses, it still looks great on a shelf. There are no yellow stickers included for the heat battleaxe, which is a bit of a disappointment as I had to paint it myself. As the Dilanza has mostly smooth and rounded armor, there aren't many opportunities for panel lining. The feet are surprisingly articulate for their design, and the kit is able to balance on its "toe". The kit has water slide decals available, that can really benefit the overall look of the kit with extra details and markings.</p>
          <p>There isn't much to say about the Dilanza itself as it spends most of its time on screen being obliterated by Gundam Aerial, but it has a cool and unusual design that made it worthwhile for me to get one. The articulation is sub-par, but it's hard to expect much more from a design this bulky. Because of the lack of stickers for the heat battleaxe, I give the Standard Dilanza a 3/5.</p>
