          <h3>High Grade 1/144 Gundam Calibarn</h3>
          <p>The embodiment of a "Witch" Gundam, the Calibarn is one of the best HG gunpla kits ever released. Calibarn features detail normally reserved for real grade. From the same in-world institute as the Aerial and Lfrith, The Calibarn throws caution to the wind and prioritizes suit performance and power over pilot safety. Due to these characteristics it was sealed away until the climax of The Witch From Mercury. The kit includes the same GUND-bits as the aerial, two beam sabers, the variable rod rifle, and a runnerless stand. foil stickers for sensors and shell units are included.</p>
          <p>Gundam Calibarn features a striking single colour design that helps the reflective rainbow shell unit, and a super unique beam rifle that doubles as an additional propulsion system. The Calibarn has a geometric, futuristic design language that looks a lot more serious than most mobile suit designs. The kit has excellent articulation and the included display stand allows for flying poses without any additional cost. Caliban has small side skirts, but the rear waist boosters limit leg movement slightly. The Calibarn looks great in almost any pose, but to me it looks best in the air with the variable rod rifle front and center. The many green foil stickers can be a pain to apply, but there really isn't anything else that can recreate the look they give off. It's disappointing that all of the shell units except the V-fin are stickers, but they still look really good despite that. The GUND-bits can be displayed attached to the suit or formed into the ecutcheon shield, or deployed as bit staves with sold-separately stands. The booster "petals" on the variable rod rifle are fully articulated and can be displayed folded up or deployed. The backpack boosters are on ball joints that allow for great posing. The heel and toe portions of the foot can be folded together into "High-Maneuverability mode". Due to the white armor, panel lining makes this kit look very striking.</p>
          <p>The HG Gundam Calibarn is one of my favorite kits as I keep it inside of my PC as part of its aesthetics. Despite having a lot of stickers, they are all used very tastefully and don't detract from the kit much, unless you really dislike applying stickers. I give the HG Gundam Calibarn a 4.5/5.</p>
