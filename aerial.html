          <h3>Full Mechanics 1/100 Gundam Aerial</h3>
          <p>The only 1/100 scale entry to The Witch From Mercury gunpla lineup, Gundam Aerial was my first gunpla model kit. Aerial features unique glittering red shell units with 3-dimensional printing not present on the HG version. Gundam Aerial features 11 "Gund-Bits" that can be detached from the mobile suit and displayed in swarm mode, or form together into the escuteon shield. Aerial also includes a beam rifle with effect parts, and two beam sabres that can be stored on the backpack. Sticker-style decals are included for warning markings and logos on the suit</p>
          <p>Gundam Aerial is one of my favourite mobile suits, so I was very excited to see that she received a 1/100 scale release. Compared to other 1/100 scale kits that I have built (such as the MG Gundam AGE-II Magnum), the Aerial is extremely sturdy and can easily balance in ground poses. When posed on a stand, Aerial's excellent articulation truly shines. Due to Aerial's lack of bulky skirting armor compared to other mobile suits and rounded thigh armor, the legs feature amazing articulation. The knee joints contain a sliding mechanism, so when the knee is bent some of the armor panels will slide down to cover the gaps made by the joint. Aerial's shoulder joints feature multiple points of rotation for dynamic action poses. The kit's hands have opposable thumbs which are excellent for posing, but are just barely strong enough to hold the beam rifle with its beam effect attached. </p>
          <p>The Full Mechanics 1/100 Gundam Aerial is one of the best kits in my collection, and really does the Aerial's design justice. The kit has an excellent build, and the payoff is worth the high price for a non MG kit. Overall, I would Give this kit a 4.8/5 rating. This kit would have been perfect out of box if not for the weak opposable thumbs.</p>
