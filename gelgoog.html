          <h3>High Grade 1/144 Bocata's Gelgoog</h3>
          <p>Despite only appearing in one episode, Bocata's custom paintjob Gelgoog got an amazing HG rendition. Like the rest of the kits in the GQuuuuuuX lineup the Gelgoog's design is unlike anything seen before in Gunpla. With a design that was reverse engineered in-lore from the RX-78-02 "White Gundam", the design does not resemble other Zeon built mobile suits. The kit includes one short beam saber, and dual beam submachine guns. there are a few yellow colour-correcting stickers included.</p>
          <p>The Zeon MS-14A Gelgoog has existed for almost as long as the Gundam franchise itself, and has been largely unchanged for that time until GQuuuuuuX came along and intoduced some amazing alternate-reality designs of classic zeon and E.F.S.F. mobile suits and mobile armors. The GQuuuuuuX Gelgoog has a much more thin, human like design with light armor and exposed booster fuel tanks. Being designed for space combat, the Gelgoog features four leg boosters and dual boosters on the backpack. Like the GQuuuuuuX, the Gelgoog has unique arm joints that only need one joint but still feature nearly full articulation. This kit will pull off any in-air or ground pose you want it to, and will hold it reliably because of its plastic on plastic joints. The loadout of the Gelgoog is also unusual, with dual beam submachine guns and a single beam saber pointing to its mass produced design rather than the one-off designs of the White Gundam and GQuuuuuuX. The yellow colour-corecting stickers for the legs blend in well it would be nice to have these details molded as seperate parts, the stickers blend in fine. The Gelgoog can benefit a lot from some pane lining and a little bit of paint on details, as it upgraded the look of my kit quite a lot. </p>
          <p>The GQ 1/144 Bocata's Gelgoog has a decent price for a high grade, has amazing details for one too, and has great articulation. other than a few stickers, there is really nothing to complain about this kit. I Would rate the Gelgoog a 4/5.</p>
