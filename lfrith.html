          <h3>High Grade 1/144 Gundam Lfrith</h3>
          <p>The first kit to be released in the HG Witch From Mercury line, Gundam Lfrith became the new standard for High Grade gunpla quality. As the Lfrith is the predecessor of the aerial, they have similar silhouettes and weapon systems. Gundam Lfrith really sells the design of a prototype, with exposed boosters and a bare bones flight unit on the backpack. Gundam Lfrith comes with the receiver rifle with beam blade effect part, similar GUND-bits to the Aerial, and two beam sabers. Green foil stickers are included for use on the camera sensors.</p>
          <p>Gundam Lfrith has just about anything you could want from a HG kit, great articulation, nice build, amazing design, and reasonable price. The backpack flight unit has great articulation for all four boosters, allowing for great flying poses. The GUND-bits mount to the Lfrith differently than to the Aerial, with most of the bits mounting to the flight unit instead of the arms and legs of the mobile suit. The Lfrith has a molded shell unit part on the chest, which looks leagues better than the stickers present on the Calibarn or Schwarzette. Since Lfrith is mostly white like the Calibarn, it benefits a ton from panel lining. The pick accent colour makes for a very striking and unique design compared to most other gundams. Lfrith features a unique V-fin that is shaped more like antennas or bunny ears than the typical crest on the forehead of a Gundam. The "toe" portion of the feet are connected via a ball joint, allowing for more diverse poses than most other gunpla. The included effect part can be attached to the receiver rifle to recreate the close-range combat mode from the Witch From Mercury Prologue. If you're looking for gundams with a more feminine design that you can actually find in stock, the Lfrith and Aerial are your best bet. Since the Lfrith, Aerial, and Calibarn were designed by the same people, they have a similar design language and build up similarly.</p>
          <p>I really can't find anything wrong with the HG Gundam Lfrith, other than that there isn't a master grade version! The articulation is perfect, the weapons are cool, and the design looks great. I give the HG Gundam Lfrith a 5/5</p>
